--Observations:

--The categories with the highest average customer ratings are not necessarily those with the highest sales or the most orders. 
--For example, "books_general_interest" has lower average ratings than "cds_dvds_musicals" and "fashion_childrens_clothes", 
--but it far outperforms them in terms of sales and order numbers.

--On the other hand, categories with lower average ratings, like "pc_gamer" and "security_and_services", 
--also tend to have lower sales and order numbers. This could suggest that lower customer satisfaction 
--in these categories is impacting their sales performance negatively.

--Some categories, despite having middling or low ratings, still have high sales and order numbers. 
--"office_furniture", for instance, has a relatively low average rating of 3.52, but its total sales 
--are substantial at 652016.50, with a total of 1788 orders. This could indicate factors other than customer 
--ratings that are contributing to the sales performance of these categories, such as product necessity, 
--lack of alternative vendors, or effective marketing.

-- Query to get the distribution of ratings across all products
SELECT r.review_score AS rating, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM reviews r
JOIN orders o ON r.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN items i ON i.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

-- This indicates that a majority of the products sold on Olist received the highest rating of 5 stars, 
-- suggesting high customer satisfaction. The number of products that received lower ratings (1 to 4 stars) 
--is significantly less, with the 1-star and 4-star ratings being the next most common after the 5-star rating.

-- This distribution is a good indication that, overall, customers are generally satisfied with the 
--products they purchase from Olist. However, there is a notable number of 1-star ratings (the 
--lowest rating), indicating there may be some products or areas of service that could be improved.

--9. What is the average order cancellation rate on Olist, and how does this impact seller performance?
SELECT 
    ROUND((CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN o.order_status = 'canceled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) 
	 / COUNT(*) * 100):: NUMERIC, 2) AS avg_cancellation_rate
FROM orders o;


-- Calculate average sales for sellers who have had an order cancelled
SELECT 'Sellers with cancelled orders' AS seller_type, AVG(seller_orders) AS average_seller_orders
FROM (
    SELECT s.seller_id, COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS seller_orders
    FROM orders o
    INNER JOIN items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    INNER JOIN sellers s ON i.seller_id = s.seller_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'canceled'
    GROUP BY s.seller_id
) subquery
UNION ALL
-- Calculate average sales for all sellers
SELECT 'All sellers' AS seller_type, AVG(seller_orders) AS average_seller_orders
FROM (
    SELECT s.seller_id, COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS seller_orders
    FROM orders o
    INNER JOIN items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    INNER JOIN sellers s ON i.seller_id = s.seller_id
    GROUP BY s.seller_id
) subquery;

-- The average order cancellation rate on Olist is 0.63%. This is a relatively low rate, suggesting 
--that the majority of orders placed on Olist are successfully completed.

-- Sellers who have had an order cancelled average about 1.4 orders, while the average for all 
--sellers is about 32.3 orders. This suggests a strong negative impact of order cancellations on 
--seller performance.


--10. What are the top-selling products on Olist, and how have their sales trends changed over time

WITH product_sales AS (
    SELECT pr.product_category_name AS name,
           EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.purchase_date) AS year,
           COUNT(o.order_id) AS sales
    FROM products pr
    JOIN items i ON pr.product_id = i.product_id
    JOIN orders o ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    GROUP BY name, year
),

top_products AS (
    SELECT name, SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC) AS rank
    FROM product_sales
    GROUP BY name
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT ps.name, ps.year, ps.sales
FROM product_sales ps
JOIN top_products tp ON ps.name = tp.name
ORDER BY tp.rank, ps.year;

--The top-selling product categories over the years include "bed_bath_table", 
-- "health_beauty", "sports_leisure", "furniture_decor", and "computers_accessories".

--All of these categories show a year-over-year growth from 2016 to 2017, 
--and most of them also show growth from 2017 to 2018. This indicates a generally increasing demand 
--for these products over the years.

-- The "bed_bath_table" category had the highest sales in 2018, while the "health_beauty" category 
-- had the second highest.

-- However, some categories such as "telephony" and "garden_tools" seem to have stagnant or 
-- declining sales from 2017 to 2018. This could indicate a decrease in demand or increased 
-- competition in these categories.

-- Some categories like "watches_gifts" and "auto" started with relatively lower sales in 
-- 2016 but showed significant growth in the following years.
